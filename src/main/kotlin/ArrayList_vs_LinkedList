ArrayList :

1. Internally uses dynamic array.
2. Manipulation is slow as bit shifting is required in memory.
3. Can act as a list only because it implements List only.
4. Better for storing and accessing data.
5. Memory location for elements is contiguous.
6. Default capacity of 10 is initialized.


LinkedList :

1. Internally uses double linked list.
2. Manipulation is faster as bit shifting is required in memory.
3. Can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.
4. Better for manipulating data.
5. Memory location for elements is not contagious.
6. No default capacity. Empty list is created initially.
